# SAS-Chainsaw
Some very basic but  important SAS(Statistical Analysis System)Scripts. Contains Base SAS, SAS SQL and SAS Macros codes to make life easy.

First things first, you need SAS software to even open these file, except the PDFs 😅, and also basic SAS Programming to even UNDERSTAND these codes😁😁😁, but if you want to learn SAS PROGRAMMING then come tell me on my telegram.
I will teach you three SAS languages (Base SAS, SAS SQL & SAS Macros).
